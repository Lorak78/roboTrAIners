This repository contains our DM65 AI course material, we decided to explore **ROBOTIS' TurtleBot3**. 

## Introduction to TurtleBot
TurtleBot is a standardized robotic platform developed for ROS education and research. The concept of the TurtleBot platform is derived from Turtle robots used to teach foundational robotics and computer science since the early 1940s. TurtleBot is designed as a simplified, easily upgradable platform to teach people who are new to ROS, and to provide a capable base system for more advanced development. Since itâ€™s inception TurtleBot has become the standard educational ROS platform, as well as the most popular robotics platform among developers and students worldwide.

## Getting started with TurtleBot3
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Above some of the web guide tabs, you will have these options to choose from

It is **REALLY IMPORTANT** for you to stick with one and only one of these, if you mix up the different guide versions, you might have to restart from scratch.
**Note:** not every page has the *jazzy* option, as it is still WIP, so i highly recommend not choosing that one.
To get started with **TurtleBot** we followed [this](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup) guide, make sure to follow it carefully,
as this robot is **NOT** compatible with some versions of Ubuntu.

## Languages and technologies used
TurtleBot is compatible with Python using **RosPy**, then to build programs you may use the commands listed in the guide (such as `catkin_make`)

## Further development
Everything the TurtleBot is able to do is written in the [guide](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/), on the tabs on the left side of the web page, look up for anything you need, and make sure to select the right guide version (*Noetic, Humble*).
